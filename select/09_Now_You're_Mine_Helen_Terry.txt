Here is my guy, the one you're most used for[?]
Oh we will find, together it's you boy
Now we have found each other forever
Turn us on now, plug me in
Oooooh, love so fine
Oooooh, Now it's mine
Oooooh, Your'e so fine
Oooooh, Now you're mine
Just a little of your love and I'll be fine
Take me in your loving arms and you'll be mine
Ohh, a-asking for your lips should never ever be too bold
Mmmm, I'm feeling some reaction now I thought I'd never know.
Hey and I say
Oooooh, Love so fine
Oooooh, Now it's mine.
Before my world was needing the power of this
Special touch that all electric dreams are made of
And with your magic hand of love you led me to a place where
I can feel your energy, now I feel it touching me
I can feel the energy now I feel you touching me
Life is getting better now, soon you will see
Everything surrounding you is looking fine to me
Ooh, hoo, I never knew your power baby would make me feel so great
I'm needing you beside me now, in every move I make
Ooh and I say
Hey you're so fine
Oooooh, now you're mine
Hey you're so fine
Oooooh, now you're mine
