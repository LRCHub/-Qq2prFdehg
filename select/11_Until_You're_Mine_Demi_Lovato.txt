My state of mind
Has kind of got the best of me
I need you next to me
I'm trying to find
A way that I could get to you
I just wanna get to you
The world I see is perfect now
You're all around
With you I can breath
[Chorus]
Until you're mine
I have to find
A way to fill this hole inside
I've got to fight
Without you here by my side
Until you're mine
Not gonna be
Even close to complete
I won't rest until you're mine
Mine
All lonely inside
I can only hear your voice
Ringing threw the noise
I can find my mind
Keeps on coming back to you
Yeah always back to you
Wanting something out of reach
It's killing me
And you're all I see yeah
[Chorus]
Yes I'm wondering
If we were meant to be
Forget about wanting to soar
I'm ready to begin
Our waiting has to end
Right now
Too late
I've got to find a way yeah yeah
Mine
Until you're mine
Until you're mine
Without you here by my side
Until you're mine
Not gonna be
Even close to complete
I wont rest until you're mine
My state of mind
Is finding all the best from me
I need you next to me
