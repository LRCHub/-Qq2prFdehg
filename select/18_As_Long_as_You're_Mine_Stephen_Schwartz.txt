Kiss me too fiercly hold me too tight
I need help believing you're with me tonight
My wildest dreaming could not forsee
Lying beside you with you wanting me
Just for this moment
I've lost all resistance
And crossed the border line
And if it turns out
It's over to fast
I'll make every last moment last
Maybe I'm brainless maybe I'm wise
But you've got me seeing through different eyes
Somehow I've fallen under your spell
And somehow I'm feeling so glad I fell
Every moment as long as you're mine
I wake my body
And make up for lost time
Say there's no future
For us as a pair
And though I may know I don't care
Just for this moment
Come be how you want to
And see how bright we shine
Borrow the moonlight untill it is through
And know I'll be here holding you
What is it?
It's just, for the first time
I feel... wicked
