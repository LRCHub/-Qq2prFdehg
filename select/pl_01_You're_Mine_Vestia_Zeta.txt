As the city lights come alive
Shadows of the night
Help me spin my web
Got my target there in my sight
He can run and hide
But he can't be saved
Goin' in as I make my move
Smooth as that jazzy groove
While the music's playin'
Lethal with a drink in my hand
I've been working a plan
And it's goin' good
Cheers to all your secrets
your desires
全てを手に入れるまで
I won't stop
Don't you hide from me
I can see through your eyes
秘密だって
Locked away でも隠しきれない
最強なsecret agent
罠をかければ... you're mine
I can see through your eyes
何処にいても
In the dark でも逃げきれない
最強なsuper powerでつかまえる
Got him all caught up in my web
Every word he's said
Ready for replay
Then I slipped
and he knew my hand
Took off and he ran
Thought he could escape
Cheers to all your secrets
your desires
今さら気付いてもtoo late
Cause I won't stop
Don't you hide from me
Catch and release?
Do you think?
そんなヘマはしない
最後に仕留めるのがmy style
Let you swim for now but
You're すでにmine
Just reel in the line
No matter how far
you may run to...
I can see through your eyes
何処にいても
In the dark でも逃げきれない
最強なsuper powerでつかまえる
I can see through your eyes
秘密だって
Locked away でも隠しきれない
最強なsecret agent
罠をかければ... you're mine
I can see through your eyes
何処にいても
In the dark でも逃げきれない
最強なsuper powerでつかまえる
Baby you're mine
Run but you can't hide
狙ったらもう離さない
Baby you're mine
Always one step behind
I'll take my time
Cause baby you're mine
